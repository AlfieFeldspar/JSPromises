# JSPromises
A reference repo containing paired javascript files to illustrate syntax
for native (ES6) promises (=asynchronous processes), including new Promise, .then, .catch, 
async...await (ES8), and executor functions.
One file contains modules that are exported to the paired ...app.js file, which requires
them in.
